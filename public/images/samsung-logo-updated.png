Since the task is to replace the file `samsung-logo-updated.png` with `samsung-logo.png`, and there is no existing code, the "code" to be created is simply the instruction to use the new file. This isn't really code, but rather a change in configuration or file reference. Since I can't directly manipulate files, I'll represent this as a comment indicating the required change.

// Replace the file samsung-logo-updated.png with samsung-logo.png in the carousel configuration.
